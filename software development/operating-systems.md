## Processes
A process is a program in execution.
When loaded into memory it becomes a process, and it can be divided into four sections:
1. Stack
   Contains temporary data: method/function paramters, return address and local variables
2. Heap
   Dynamically allocated memory to a process during its run time.
3. Text
   Program counter.
4. Data
   Contains global and static variables.
