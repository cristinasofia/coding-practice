## Interface vs. Abstract Class
# Interfaces
- Blueprint of a class.
- Achieves total abstraction, can achieve multiple inheritance, used to achieve loose coupling, implements abstraction.
# Abstract Class

1. Cannot be created. Can be referenced.
2. Can contain constructors. Constructor of an abstract class is called when an instance of an inherited class is created.
3. Abstract class without an abstract method.
4. Can have methods that cannot be overridden.
5. Instantiation is not possible.
