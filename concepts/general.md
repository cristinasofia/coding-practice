## Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming
### Encapsulation
Binding together data and the functions that manipulate them.
    <pre>
    <code>
    class Bird():
    </code>
    </pre>
### Abstraction
Providing only essential information about data while hiding the details or implementation.
### Inheritance
Ability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class.</p>
### Polymorphism
Define one interface and have multiple implementations.
- Polymorphism with class methods:
    <pre>
    <code>
    class Bird():
    </code>
    </pre>
- Polymorphism with Inheritance
    <pre>
    <code>
    class Bird():
    </code>
    </pre>
- Polymorphism with Function:
    <pre>
    <code>
    class Bird():
    </code>
    </pre>
- Polymorphism with Function and Objects:
    <pre>
    <code>
    class Bird():
    </code>
    </pre>

## S.O.L.I.D Principles
### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have a single job.
<pre>
<code>
    class User:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
    def get_name(self)->str:
        pass
    def save(self, user: User):
        pass
</code>
</pre>
### Open-Closed Principle
Open for extension, not modification.
### Liskov Substitution Principle
Classes are completely isolated and unaware of changes in the class hierarchy.
### Interface Segregation Principle
### Dependency Inversion Principle
