# P, NP, and NP-Complete
P, NP, and NP-Complete refer to classes of problems. 
- **P** problems are problems that can be quickly solved (where "quickly" means **P**olynomial time). 
- **NP** problems are those where, given a solution, the solution can be quickly verified. 
- **NP-Complete** problems are a subset of NP problems that can all be reduced to each other (that is, if you found a solution to one problem, you could tweak the solution to solve other problems in the set in polynomial time). 
- **NP-Hard** problems are an important set of problems for
which no polynomial algorithm is known.
